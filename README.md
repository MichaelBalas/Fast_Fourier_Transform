# Fast Fourier Transform
The goal of this project was to learn more about one of the most influential algorithms of the 20th century: the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Essentially, it encompasses a family of algorithms that efficiently implement the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or its inverse. Included in this repository is a [document](FFT_Document.pdf) and [slideshow](FFT_Slideshow.pdf) that outline its background, mathematical expression, algorithmic complexity and structure. I have also experimented with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), a purely-functional programming language for webapps, to declaratively create a browser-based animation for the FFT.
